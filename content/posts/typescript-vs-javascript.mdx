JavaScript is a powerful, dynamic language and there are many ways to approach it. Depending on your needs, you can use Typescript or JavaScript.

In this article, we will discuss the benefits of using Typescript over JavaScript and when you should use it. After reading this blog post, you will be able to determine if writing code in TypeScript is better suited for your team’s workflow than JavaScript and vice versa.

## What is Typescript?

Typescript is a new programming language that compiles plain old JavaScript. It is a superset of JavaScript, meaning it adds optional static type checking and type definitions to the language.

This allows you to write safer, more efficient code that runs properly regardless of the environment it runs in. Its type definitions also allow you to quickly write APIs and other code that can be consumed by other languages. Typescript is a superset of JavaScript that provides static type checking and type definitions.

This allows you to write safer, more efficient code. Typescript is a superset of JavaScript that provides static type checking and type definitions. This allows you to write safer, more efficient code.

## JavaScript vs. TypeScript

The main difference between JavaScript and Typescript is that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, while AngularJS, React, and Vue.js are JavaScript frameworks. For example, while Vue.js is a framework, it is still a superset of JavaScript.

Some of the key differences between JavaScript and TypeScript are: - Type annotations for variables, functions, classes, and modules - As you would expect, this allows you to annotate variable types. - Strongly typed variables - This means that you don’t have to declare a type for each variable. - Type definitions - This refers to the ability to define types for variables, functions, classes, and modules.

## Advantages of Typescript

Type Safety - This means that you have the peace of mind that your code won’t accidentally throw errors. You also have the benefit of auto-completion when writing code, which results in shorter, more readable code. Scalability - A key advantage of TypeScript is that it allows for a highly scalable codebase.

This means that your code doesn’t get bogged down by the sheer volume of code it consumes. Standardization - JavaScript has had a tumultuous journey, ready for the mainstream. It has been through the wringer and emerged stronger than ever. It has also gained popularity because of its use in the web ecosystem, but there are other ecosystems, where it has a lower adoption rate.

## Disadvantages of Typescript

The one major disadvantage of TypeScript is that it generates a lot of code. This requires programmatic thinking like reading and understanding, and also getting used to a new codebase. It also means that you have to tool around with the different IDEs and processes they have.

This can be daunting to some teams. Codebase Bloat - Another disadvantage of TypeScript is its codebase bloat. This mainly has to do with the fact that it generates a lot of code. This means that you have to keep your codebase clean, and also keep it small.
